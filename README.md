### An Ixion mod with a bunch of random tweaks.
---

Right now everything is hard-coded. I'll probably ad a config in the future, but I'm just fucking around right now.

I will not add a release binary till I add the config. **This means you will have to compile it yourself if you want to use this.**


### Requirements:
---

- The game obviously.
- BepInEx. You **need the v6 pre-release**! V5 does not support IL2CPP games! https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
- A brain. This isn't a "click once and it's installed kinda thing". I will provide file path examples, the rest is on you.

### Installation:

- Extract BepInEx so you wind up with `IXION\winhttp.dll` in the game folder.
- Compile this.
- Place the compiled dll as `IXION\BepInEx\plugins\GMod.dll` in the game folder.
